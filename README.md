# Lib Design Tokens

## Introduction

This project aims to create a cohesive and efficient platform that provides all the necessary elements for developing systems aligned with the organization's design guidelines. This project consolidates resources that form the foundation for all user interface components, ensuring visual consistency and a unified user experience.

## Features

- **Color Variables**: Defining color palettes that align with the organization's visual identity, ensuring consistent color usage throughout the system.
- **Spacing and Margins**: A set of rules defining spacing between interface elements, which helps maintain harmony and readability in the design.
- **Typography Styles**: Comprehensive definitions for font families, sizes, weights, and other typographic parameters, enabling text creation that adheres to the organization's standards.
- **Shadows and Effects**: Standardized guidelines for applying shadows, gradients, and other visual effects that add depth and dynamism to designs while maintaining stylistic consistency.
- **Utility Classes**: A set of universal utility classes that enable quick and easy application of styles without the need to write complex CSS rules. These classes allow for instant implementation of properties such as margins, padding, colors, text alignment, and responsive layouts, accelerating the interface development process and increasing flexibility.
